    <h2>I. General Objective</h2>
    <p>{% if content %}{{ content.general_objective }}{% else %}Loading content...{% endif %}</p>
    
    <p>
        The platform aims to educate the public on how forest loss contributes to climate change, 
        endangers wildlife, and threatens ecosystem stability. By providing accessible digital information, 
        this initiative empowers communities—especially the younger generation—to take active roles in 
        environmental stewardship.
    </p>

    <h2>II. Specific Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Increase public understanding of the severe impacts of deforestation and biodiversity decline.</li>
        <li>Analyze climate-related consequences such as rising CO₂ levels, ecosystem disruption, and habitat loss.</li>
        <li>Provide a free, research-based online platform for environmental education.</li>
        <li>Identify key drivers of deforestation, including agriculture, logging, and urban development.</li>
        <li>Raise awareness on the global and local consequences of biodiversity loss.</li>
        <li>Inspire citizens to participate in conservation and reforestation efforts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>{% if content %}{{ content.background_info }}{% else %}Loading content...{% endif %}</p>
    
    <p>
        Forests play a vital role in regulating climate, supporting wildlife, protecting watersheds, and 
        sustaining livelihoods. When forests are destroyed, ecosystems collapse and communities become more 
        vulnerable to natural disasters.
    </p>

    <p>
        ForesToFuture was created to strengthen environmental awareness and inspire nationwide action toward 
        restoring forest ecosystems and protecting wildlife.

            <h3>SDG 13: Climate Action</h3>
            <p>
                SDG 13 calls for urgent action to reduce climate impacts. Deforestation increases greenhouse 
                gases and weakens natural protection systems. Through education and advocacy, this project 
                encourages communities to adopt climate-resilient and sustainable practices.

            <h3>SDG 15: Life on Land</h3>
            <p>
                SDG 15 focuses on protecting terrestrial ecosystems and restoring degraded forests. 
                ForesToFuture highlights the importance of reforestation, wildlife conservation, and the 
                long-term protection of natural habitats.
